## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS variables
- Sass
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

I decided to implement this challenge using only pure Javascript (i.e., no React ðŸ˜¢). Because of this, I learned a lot of things that Javascript can do on its own. Using a framework will ease your life, not gonna lie, but a pure Javascript project is a font of knowledge.

### Useful resources

- [Developer Mozilla Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me to remember JS functionalities.
